# Tools used by RetroFeed

This is just a list of tools which RetroFeed uses. Things not captured by the `package.json` file basically. If you want to develop then you'd better get a hold of these things. For now, it's not a _formal_ definition, but it might become one.

In no particular order they are:
- OS: Linux / MacOS with the standard GNU setup
- NodeJs with Yarn
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Pgcli
- Bash
- Ngrok
- Travis & the travis CLI gem
